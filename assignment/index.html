    <p>For #17, I was getting an error message for my switch statment until
      I called luckyNumber directly before the switch statement. Why did I
      need to call it again right before my switch statement when I had already 
      declared it earlier in my code? As a rule, do you always call the 
      expression directly before you assign it to a switch statement? </p>
