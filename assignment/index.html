    <p>For #17, I was getting an error message for my switch statment until
      I called luckyNumber directly before the switch statement. Why did I
      need to call it again right before my switch statement when I had already 
      declared it earlier in my code? As a rule, do you always call the 
      expression directly before you assign it to a switch statement? </p>

      <p>For #3, I wasn't sure how to get a space between my first and last name
        so I added a space after my first name. What is a better/correct way to
        achieve a space?
      </p>

      <p>Got sick over the weekend so I did not have the energy to finish all stretch
        goals :(
      </p>

      <p>For #18, am I doing this right by adding a variable
        (is "message" a variable?) before ternary operator so that I can 
        console.log it?
      </p>
